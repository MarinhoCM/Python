# Find Domain Name From DNS Pointer (PTR) Records Using IP Address
#### Write a function that takes an IP address and returns the domain name using PTR DNS records.

## Notes
- You may want to import socket.
- Don't cheat and just print the domain name, you need to make a real DNS request.
- Return as a string.
