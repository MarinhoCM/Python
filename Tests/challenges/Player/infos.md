# Classes For Fetching Information on a Sports Player

#### Create a class that takes the following four arguments for a particular football player:

 - name
 - age
 - height
 - weight
  
#### Also, create three functions for the class that returns the following strings:

`get_age()` returns "name is age age"<br>
`get_height()` returns "name is height cm"<br>
`get_weight()` returns "name weighs weight kg"<br>

## Examples
p1 = player("David Jones", 25, 175, 75)

p1.get_age() ➞ "David Jones is age 25"<br>
p1.get_height() ➞ "David Jones is 175cm"<br>
p1.get_weight() ➞ "David Jones weighs 75kg"<br>

## Notes
#### name will be passed in as a string and age, height, weight will be integers.
