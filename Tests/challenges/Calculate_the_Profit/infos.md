# Calculate the Profit
#### You work for a manufacturer, and have been asked to calculate the total profit made on the sales of a product. You are given a dictionary containing the cost price per unit (in dollars), sell price per unit (in dollars), and the starting inventory. Return the total profit made, rounded to the nearest dollar.

## Notes
- Assume all inventory has been sold.
- Profit = Total Sales - Total Cost
